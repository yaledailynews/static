# Things to Not Forget

## Wordpress
- add database to git

## Site-wide

- merge multiple sytlesheets
- mobile header (menu buttom + XC popout)  

## Homepage
- figure out bottom of Cross Campus megabox 
- Nav color highlighting
- SASS logic for different category colors
- Breaking flag (full-width and top right versions) 
- ads?
- more efficient packery logic (rather than repeating for each section:
 - `data-packery-options='{ "itemSelector": ".card", "gutter": 38.5, "containerStyle": null }`
- cover story image needs to be made inline
 ## Responsive
 -  big kahuna -> full-bleed
 - 2x2 -> 2x1
 - 2x1 w/ image -> same
 - 2x1 w/o image -> 1x1
 - 1x1 -> headline list
 - remove packery on mobile at 480px breakpoint
